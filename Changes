Revision history for Test-WWW-Mechanize

WWW::Mechanize and Test::WWW::Mechanize do not use rt.cpan.org for
bug tracking.  They are now being tracked via Google Code at

NEXT

http://code.google.com/p/www-mechanize/issues/detail?id=9

Fixed punctuation in some error messages.

Fixed compatibility with WWW::Mechanize 1.36.


1.18    Thu Dec  6 10:12:14 CST 2007
------------------------------------
[ENHANCEMENTS]
Added default descriptions for most test assertions.

[FIXES]
HTML::Lint is now properly optional.

Added delays in all the tests that use HTTP::Server::Simple to give
it time to correctly fire up.

[FIXES]

1.14    Fri May 11 16:22:02 CDT 2007
------------------------------------
[FIXES]
Fixes test failures.  Thanks to Mark Blackman for RT #26602:

The module tests currently spawn a server (based on
HTTP::Server::Simple::CGI) which is killed when a __DIE__
signal is received, normally only when the invoking
perl dies. However, as perlvar makes clear, the __DIE__
signal is received when eval blocks die as well. The
new version (1.22) of WWW::Mechanize now calles
HTTP::Message::decoded_content which calls Encode.pm
which has a eval block that require's Encode::ConfigLocal
which is usually not present, so the eval dies and the
HTTP server is killed as soon as the $mech object tries
to do a 'get'. It's simple to use a system variable,
$^S to find out if the __DIE__ signal is being called
for an eval so we ignore that case with the patch
attached.

The stuff_inputs() function now actually works.

[DOCUMENTATION]
*   Made the synopsis show that T:W:M doesn't take the tests=>$x
like other Test::* modules.  It'd be nice if it did, though.


1.12    Thu Jul  6 23:47:59 CDT 2006
------------------------------------
[ENHANCEMENTS]
Added followable_links() method to return only those links
that your mech can actually follow.


1.10    Sun Jun 18 22:58:41 CDT 2006
------------------------------------
[FIXES]
RT #19147: Tests turn off the http_proxy environment variable before
starting.  Thanks to Matt Trout.

RT #18779: makes stuff_inputs() conform to the documentation,
changing the implementation to expect an arrayref for $options->{ignore},
as opposed to a hashref.  Thanks to Mike O'Regan.

[ENHANCEMENTS]
Added base_is, base_like and base_unlike.  Thanks to MATSUNO Tokuhiro.


1.08    Mon Nov 21 10:35:23 CST 2005
------------------------------------
[FIXES]
has_tag_like()'s regex was reversed, so would match when it shouldn't.
Thanks to Chris Dolan.

Added links to support sites.
